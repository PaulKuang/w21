Hi everyone! I’m April and I’m a 4th year B.S/M.S student in Computer Science. I’ve been a tutor in the
CS Undergraduate Learning Assistants (ULA) program since Fall 2019 because I love helping students,
especially students who are new to programming. Courses I've tutored for are CS8, CS16, CS32, CS64, and
currently CS190J. When I’m not glued to my computer, I enjoy cooking and exercising. Please feel free to
visit my office hours if you need any help, advice, or just want someone to study with :)

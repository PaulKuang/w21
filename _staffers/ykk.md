Hi everyone! This is my first time as the official CS190J instructor. 
I am looking forward to working with you to help students make learning easier and more engaging. 

This term, I'm going to be on the other side of the world (11-12 time zones ahead of Santa Barbara), teaching CS 8 and helping with the Data Science initiative.
I love getting to know my students, organizing fun social events, and drinking copious amounts of tea (sometimes, doing all of it simultaneously ;-)).

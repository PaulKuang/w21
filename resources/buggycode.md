## Peer-reviewed tutoring
In preparation for the 1-on-1 observations, we will practice assisting students with real debugging problems and get feedback on your tutoring.

### What are we practicing?

* Being welcoming, encouraging, and mindful of your tone and body language
* Giving students the appropriate level of help
* Helping students pick up cool debugging strategies
* Use of visualizations, explanations and other techniques when appropriate
* Managing your time (rule of thumb is to keep your interaction under 10 minutes, although depends on the context)

## Prior to class

Students submit 
* the hardest questions they were asked so far related to concepts and code
* buggy student code prior to the class (redact any student-specific information)

Follow the instructions in the README that's in the `resources/_buggycode-peer-review/csXX-NN-NetID` directory.

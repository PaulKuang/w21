## Peer-reviewed tutoring
In preparation for the 1-on-1 observations, we will practice assisting students with real debugging problems and get feedback on your tutoring.

### What are we practicing?

* Being welcoming, encouraging, and mindful of your tone and body language
* Giving students the appropriate level of help
* Helping students pick up cool debugging strategies
* Use of visualizations, explanations and other techniques when appropriate
* Managing your time (rule of thumb is to keep your interaction under 10 minutes, although depends on the context)

## Prior to class

Students submit 
* The hardest questions they were asked so far related to concepts and code
* Buggy student code prior to the class. They can either create their own example or use a student's example (redact any student-specific information)


### Bringing your fork up to date with the main repo 

Before you begin updating _your fork_ with the files requested in this assignment, let's make sure that your fork is up-to-date with the main website branch (also referred to as `master`, `upstream master`).

* On GitHub, in the list of your repos, find the fork of this repo (you forked it before to add your bio). You can also find it by going to this website's main repo and clicking on the number next to the "Fork" button.
* On your fork's GitHub page, you should see the message "This branch is N commits behind usb-teaching-cs:master". Next to it is the "Compare" button that you need to click.
* You'll want to pull the changes from the main website's repo to your fork repo, so when you click the "Compare" button, you need to click the link "switching the base" (it's underneath the message "There isn't anything to compare").
* After you switch the base, you should see the commits that are in the main repo that are missing from yours. If you see the green "Able to merge" note, then click on the green "Create pull request" button.
* This pull request is for merging the changes in the main repo, which happened since your last commit, into _your_ fork, so you will need to approve/merge this PR yourself in order to bring your repo up to speed with the main repo. Click on "Merge pull request" to complete the merging.

### Submitting your changes as a Pull Request (PR)

You should now be all set to add the files requested in this assignment and then issue a PR like you did when you submitted your bio in order to request for these changes to be added to the main repo.

Follow the instructions in the README that's in the `resources/_buggycode-peer-review/csXX-NN-NetID` directory.

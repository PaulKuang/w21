# Teaching Resources
{: .no_toc .mb-2 }

Throughout this course, we will be using various resources and references.

Below are some of the teaching tips that we outlined during our initial lectures.

### Don't
* Don't take control of the student's keyboard (without asking).
  - Doesn't apply as much in time of Covid (over Zoom), but even so.
* Don't give away the answer (unless a student is really stuck / is extremely frustrated, the answer is very trivial).
* Don't be condescending.
* Don't be afraid to say "I don't know but let's find out".
* Don't undermine the course, the lab, the instructor, your peers.
* Don't use terms that students don't know
  - Or if you do, "remind them" what the term means.


### Do
* Keep your cool even if the student is anxious or belligerent.
* Keep the interaction interesting.
* Refer to the lab/homework write up and syllabus where appropriate.
* If you don't know how to handle a situation, inform the TA or instructor.
* Reflect on your tutoring/TA sessions to thoghtfully and deliberately improve.

## Contributed by YOURNAME

Delete these instructions in your final submission.

* Copy this folder and remove the underscore in its name.
* Replace the information in the directory/folder name and the headings above.
    * Note that the NetID in the folder name refers to _your_ NetID.
    * If you have more than one example to contribute, then create a new directory `CSXX-NN-NetID` and increment the `NN` accordingly.


* Submit a buggy student code - call it `buggy.ext`
  * submit the file with the appropriate extension, e.g., `ext` can be .py, .cpp, .ipynb
  * include the files necessary to run your submission (e.g., the Makefile, the data file(s))
  * leave only the relevant code necessary to understand the problem
  * redact any student-specific information


### Programming question

Referring to the buggy file that you submitted, include any relevant questions that a student may ask about it. 

For example,
 >   buggy.cpp: When computing estimate for pi, students have a question: "when I input 1 the first time, it works. But after it, the number is way off. I don't understand what is going on." (The code is in buggy.cpp)

### Conceptual questions

Include questions that students asked that relate to concepts and code.

For example, 
*  When to use a `for` loop vs. a `while` loop?
*  What is the difference between a reference and a pointer?
